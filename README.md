# **Project 4 Submission in CarND-Term1**
This repository contains project 5 submission in Self-Driving Car Nano-Degree, Term 1. The main task of this project is detect vehicles on a video stream captured by a front-mounted camera, and put bounding boxes on the detected vehicles.
##### 1. AVehicle_Detection_report.md, project writeup
##### 2. CarNano_P5.ipynb, processing pipeline for vehicle detection on video stream
##### 3. svc_param.p, support vector machine classifier parameters and feature normalization parameters
##### 5. output_images/, output images at various pipeline steps, and used in the writeup as well
##### 6. project_video_output.mp4, output video stream with vehicle bounding-boxes, by processing `project_video.mp4`
